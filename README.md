## Overview

This course introduced the core principles of building dynamic web applications using **PHP**. It focused on how to process form data, validate user input, manage session state, and integrate basic web logic into real-world scenarios.

While Coursera does not retain submitted code, I completed the course with full grades and plan to rebuild and publish my original assignments here.
